# X11_GuiLibrary_Linux

This is a from scratch GUI library using the X11 window system. The goal of this project is to create a fully functional GUI environment that can operate on an embedded Linux device like a Raspberry Pi. 

## Overview

This library relies on a page-renderer scheme to actually draw onto the display. This model allows for the abstract concept of widgets and pages. This allows for a more expandable interface as development continues. 

## Features

1. Button handling
2. Label widgets
3. Basic editing window
4. Gauge widgets
